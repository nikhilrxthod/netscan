# netscan
This network scanner script will help you to find the valid and active hosts in a network. To use this script first you must have to run the requirements script by typing   ------  [ bash requirement.sh ]

You can use the network scanner by just typing a command   ----   netscan [your network IP here in 24 bits]

You don't have to enter the full IP address of the network.

Your out will save in netscan/output/active-hosts.scan

May be the script not scan the network in your first scan so you have to run this script again.

EXAMPLE:
      
      netscan 192.168.1
      netscan 157.24.2

THANKS FOR USING THIS SCRIPT...
