# netscan
This hostscanner script will help you to find the valid and active hosts in a network. To use this script only you have to run [bash netscan 192.168.43], you have no need to enter the full IP.

My be the script not scan the network in your first scan so you have to run this script again.

THANKS FOR USING THIS SCRIPT...
